(xvii) This first body line introduces a paragraph of sample text from Wikipedia:

Extremely adept at living in human-altered areas, Canada geese have established breeding colonies in urban and cultivated habitats, which provide food and few natural predators. The success of this common park species has led to its often being considered a pest species because of its excrement, its depredation of crops, its noise, its aggressive territorial behavior toward both humans and other animals, and its habit of stalking and begging for food, a result of humans disobeying artificial feeding policies of wild animals.
