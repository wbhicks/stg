# Example 3rd Gemini blog post

(xviii) This body line, which has no two-hash predecessor, introduces a pair of paragraphs of sample text from Wikipedia:

The Canada goose was one of the many species described by Carl Linnaeus in his 18th-century work Systema Naturae. It belongs to the Branta genus of geese, which contains species with largely black plumage, distinguishing them from the grey species of the genus Anser.

Branta was a Latinised form of Old Norse BrandgÃ¡s, "burnt (black) goose" and the specific epithet canadensis is a New Latin word meaning "from Canada". According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first citation for the 'Canada goose' dates back to 1772. The Canada goose is also colloquially referred to as the "Canadian goose".
