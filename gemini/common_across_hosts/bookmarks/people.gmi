# I. People in Wikipedia

These sections, one per person, are ordered alphabetically by Wikipedia entry name (i.e. "John Doe" not "Doe, John"). Note that this reverses the typical alphabetization rule for most names in European languages.

As is the case elsewhere in this site:

* Quotations from Wikipedia entries lack footnotes when appearing within a section about that same Wikipedia entry.
* Footnotes within Wikipedia quotations have been removed.
* 30 underscores are used for thematic breaks, always between blank lines.
* The caret can be removed from both footnote parts to disable markdown rendering.
* 2 or more trailing spaces stops Markdown renderers from joining adjacent lines. In such cases I use 3 for clarity in search.

### Galileo

### Giotto

> "The year of his birth is calculated from the fact that Antonio Pucci[1], the town crier of Florence, wrote a poem in Giotto's honour in which it is stated that he was 70 at the time of his death. However, the word "seventy" fits into the rhyme of the poem better than any longer and more complex age so it is possible that Pucci used artistic license. 
> ... 
> While the Italian researchers were convinced that the body belonged to Giotto and it was reburied with honour near the grave of Filippo Brunelleschi, others have been highly sceptical." -- from

### John Baskerville

> "His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a fellow printer ... An atheist, he nonetheless printed _The Book of Common Prayer_ in 1762 and a splendid folio Bible in 1763. ... His most notable typeface, Baskerville, is held to represent the peak of transitional type face and a bridge between Old Style and Modern type design. ... A Portland stone sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, _Industry and Genius_, in his honour stands in front of Baskerville House in Centenary Square, Birmingham. It was created by local artist David Patten in 1990." -- from

> "Baskerville increased the contrast between thick and thin strokes, making the serifs sharper and more tapered, and shifted the axis 
of rounded letters to a more vertical position.[8] The curved strokes are more circular in shape, and the characters became more regula
r. These changes created a greater consistency in size and form, influenced by the calligraphy Baskerville had learned and taught as a 
young man." -- from

Benjamin Franklin, while living at No. 36 Craven Street[1a] in London in 1760, wrote to Baskerville, reporting that his font was receivi
ng unfounded criticism in London:

> "Dear Sir,
>
> Let me give you a pleasant instance of the prejudice some have entertained against your work. Soon after I returned, discoursing with
 a gentleman concerning the artists of Birmingham, he said you would be a means of blinding all the readers in the nation; for the stro
kes of your letters, being too thin and narrow, hurt the eye, and he could never read a line of them without pain. I thought, said I, y
ou were going to complain of the gloss on the paper, some object to. No, no, says he, I have heard that mentioned; but it is not that -
- it is in the form and cut of the letters themselves: they have not that natural and easy proportion between the height and thickness 
of the stroke which makes the common printing so much the more comfortable to the eye. -- You see this gentleman was a connoisseur. In 
vain I endeavoured to support your character against the charge: he knew what he felt, and could see the reason of it, and several othe
r gentlemen among his friends had made the same observation, [and so forth].
>
> Yesterday he called to visit me, when, mischievously bent to try his judgment, I stept into my closet, tore off the top of Mr. Caslon's[1b] specimen, and produced it to him as yours brought with me from Birmingham, saying, I had been examining it since he spoke to me, and could not for my life perceive the disproportion he mentioned, desiring him to point it out to me. He readily undertook it, and went over the several founts, showing me every where what he thought instances of that disproportion; and declared, that he could not then read the specimen without feeling very strongly the pain he had mentioned to me. I spared him that time the confusion of being told, that these were the types he had been reading all his life with so much ease to his eyes; the types his adored Newton is printed with, on which he has pored not a little; nay, the very types his own book is printed with, for he is himself an author, and yet never discovered this painful disproportion in them, till he thought they were yours." -- from

Baskerville's mortal remains had an eventful afterlife.

> "Baskerville died in January 1775 at his home, Easy Hill. He requested that his body be placed 'in a Conical Building in my own premi
ses Hearetofore used as a mill which I have lately Raised Higher and painted and in a vault which I have prepared for It. This Doubtles
s to many may appear a Whim perhaps It is so -- But it is a whim for many years Resolve'd upon, as I have a Hearty Contempt for all Sup
erstition ...' However, in 1821 a canal was built through the land and his body was placed on show by the landowner until Baskerville's
 family and friends arranged to have it moved to the crypt of Christ Church, Birmingham. Christ Church was demolished in 1897[3] so his
 remains were then moved, with other bodies from the crypt, to consecrated catacombs at Warstone Lane Cemetery. In 1963 a petition was 
presented to Birmingham City Council requesting that he be reburied in unconsecrated ground, according to his wishes." -- from

Baskerville's house was eventually replaced by a large, art deco, civic building (1938) named after him:

> "Baskerville House, previously called the Civic Centre, is a former civic building in Centenary Square, Birmingham, England. ... The 
site was originally occupied by the home of John Baskerville. ... World War II halted construction of Baskerville House (hence the rear
 brick wall, intended to be temporary) ..." -- from

Arthur Conan Doyle may have subtly acknowledged Baskerville (whether the man or the typeface) as partly inspiring the title of his nove
l, _The Hound of the Baskervilles_, by having Sherlock Holmes voice this remark (the italicized are newspapers, each presumably with it
s own typeface):

> "The detection of types is one of the most elementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I confess that onc
e when I was very young I confused the _Leeds Mercury_ with the _Western Morning News_. But a _Times_ leader is entirely distinctive ..
."[4]

### Paul Verlaine

> "Verlaine's last years saw his descent into drug addiction, alcoholism, and poverty. He lived in slums and public hospitals, and spent his days drinking absinthe in Paris cafés. However, the people's love for his art resurrected support and brought in an income for Verlaine: his early poetry was rediscovered, his lifestyle and strange behaviour in front of crowds attracted admiration, and in 1894 he was elected France's 'Prince of Poets' by his peers. ... he was buried in the Cimetière des Batignolles (he was first buried in the 20th division, but his grave was moved to the 11th division -- on the roundabout, a much better location -- when the Boulevard Périphérique was built)." -- from

Sculpted a monument to John Baskerville, _Industry and Genius_ (1990), which stands in Birmingham.[1]

> "On the columns of Portland Stone are reversed bronze letters spelling Virgil, the Roman poet whose works were printed by Baskerville
 in the famous typeface that bears his name, in 1757. A poem in praise of the printer appeared in the Aris's Gazette in 1751, entitled 
'Industry and Genius' from which the sculpture takes its name. The artist is David Patten, born in Birmingham in 1954 ..."[2]

> "A sculpture of the Baskerville typeface, _Industry and Genius_, in honour of John Baskerville stands outside the main entrance to Baskerville House in Centenary Square. It is by local artist David Patten and was created as part of the 'Percentage For Art' scheme in 1990. ... Made out of Portland stone and bronze, it is 150 centimetres (59 in) high, 100 centimetres (39 in) wide and 650 centimetres (256 in) long."[3]
