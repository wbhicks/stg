... argues that "... The city of New York has ... given movies a new spirit of nervous, anxious hopelessness, which is the true spirit of New York."

"This right-wing, left-wing, take-your-choice cynicism is total commercial opportunism passing itself off as an Existential view. ... to make the cops-and-robbers melodrama superficially modern by making it meaningless ..."

David_Bawden // "In 1990 he was elected pope ..."

It is a concept or worldview derived from the Buddhist teaching of the three marks of existence (三法印, sanbōin), specifically that the material world is transient and impermanent (無常, mujō), that attachment to it causes suffering (苦, ku), and ultimately all reality is an emptiness or absence of self-nature (空, kū)."

John_18:38 // 'The exact intention of Pilate has been subject to debate among scholars, with no firm conclusion. His statement may have been made in jest that the trial was a mockery, or he may have sincerely intended to reflect on the philosophical position that truth is hard to ascertain. The Greek word rendered as "truth" in English translations is "aletheia", which literally means "unconcealed" and connotes sincerity in addition to factuality and reality; whereas Jesus' use of the term appears to indicate absolute, revealed knowledge. ... Some commentators have seen significance in the fact that the anagram "Est vir qui adest" ("It is the man who is before you") can be made from the letters of "Quid est veritas".'
