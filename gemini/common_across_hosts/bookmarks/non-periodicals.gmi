... argues that "... The city of New York has ... given movies a new spirit of nervous, anxious hopelessness, which is the true spirit of New York."

"This right-wing, left-wing, take-your-choice cynicism is total commercial opportunism passing itself off as an Existential view. ... to make the cops-and-robbers melodrama superficially modern by making it meaningless ..."
