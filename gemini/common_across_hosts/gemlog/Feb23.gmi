"‘You have to be dangerous back.’ Why some LGBTQ people in New Hampshire are taking up arms

"While Pink Pistol clubs have been around since at least 2000, there’s only limited data available on gun ownership rates among LGBTQ people. In 2020, a UCLA study found that 21.5 percent of lesbian, gay and bisexual people live in a house with a firearm, compared to 36 percent of heterosexual adults. ... In terms of partisan breakdown, a recent Pew study found that about one-in-five self-identified Democrats own a gun, compared to nearly half of Republicans."
