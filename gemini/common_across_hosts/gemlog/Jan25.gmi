### "The Resentment Fueling the Republican Party Is Not Coming From the Suburbs"

=> https://www.nytimes.com/2023/01/25/opinion/rural-voters-republican-realignment.html NYT / by Thomas B. Edsall

~ As is his wont [modernize to "As is his custom"? -- ȐD], Thomas Edsall brings a wealth of citations to his argument that, in the mapping from county population density[1] to partisan lean, the slope has been smoothing out. (For readers unfamiliar with US partisanship, I've drawn three ASCII art graphs to suggest some historical context.)

~ [1]: Or, perhaps equally well, the X axis can show a county's distance from the nearest metropolitan core, i.e. on a scale from periphery to centrality. Some of the studies Edsall cites use such a model, but others use pure population density.
