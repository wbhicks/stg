"How Gerard Hutch murder trial made international headlines"

"Gerard Hutch has been cleared of murdering 33-year-old David Byrne during a boxing weigh-in at Dublin's Regency Airport Hotel in 2016. Former Sinn FÃ©in councillor Jonathan Dowdall had been charged with the murder but pleaded guilty to the lesser offence of facilitating murder. The murder was part of the Hutch-Kinahan gang feud that has claimed 18 lives."
