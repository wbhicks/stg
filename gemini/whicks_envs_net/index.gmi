# Welcome to my Gemini site on envs.net

Everything here should be considered to be under construction and incomplete.

Here's a link to a subdir holding a few sample log entries, each of which is essentially a bookmark to 3rd-party web content (typically, news articles I came across). The dates in their filenames show when the referenced article was published:

=> gemlog/

Here's the only file under a "bookmarks" subdir, holding a few sample bookmarks to 3rd-party web pages of interest to me:

=> bookmarks/non-periodicals.gmi

No gemini bookmarks here yet, but coming soon :-)
