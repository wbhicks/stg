# Syntax guide

Quotations of third-party texts appear in two formats: run-in and block. Run-in quotations are enclosed by quotation marks. Block quotations have a greater-than sign (>) in the leftmost position of each line, and may also be enclosed by quotation marks.

Where a block quotation mixes my text with third-party text, quotation marks enclose the third-party text.
